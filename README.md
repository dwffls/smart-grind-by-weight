# Smart Grind-by-Weight

**Turn any grinder into a precision smart grind-by-weight system**

[<img src="images/smart-grind-by-weight-render.PNG" alt="Smart Grind-by-Weight Modification" width="35%">](images/smart-grind-by-weight-render.PNG)

The Smart Grind-by-Weight is a user-friendly, touch interface-driven, highly accurate open source grinder modification that transforms any grinder with a motor relay accepting 3.3V logic levels into an intelligent grind-by-weight system. Originally developed for the Eureka Mignon Specialita, the system can be easily adapted for other grinders.

**The concept is simple:** Perform a "brain swap" on your grinder. Replace the original controller with our intelligent ESP32-S3 controller and add a precision load cell to the mix.

**Upgrade cost:** ‚Ç¨30-40 in parts

**Target accuracy:** ¬±0.05g tolerance

Currently the 3D printed scale components are designed for a 54mm dosing cup. You can adjust them to your specific needs using the included Fusion 360 source files.

## üß† Grinding Algorithm

Our predictive grinding system uses an intelligent approach that learns and adapts:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  start((Start Grind)) --> T[TARING]
  T --> E[PREDICTIVE<br/>learn latency & flow_rate<br/>compute motor_stop_target_weight]
  E --> S[SETTLING]
  S --> P[PULSE<br/>bounded pulse using effective_flow_rate]
  P -->|abs_error <= tolerance OR error < 0 OR pulses >= max| C[COMPLETED]
  P -->|needs more| S
```

Key ideas:
- Determine grind latency from first detectable flow over a 500ms confirmation window.
- Compute a motor stop target weight from latency x flow x coast ratio (USER_LATENCY_TO_COAST_RATIO).
- Stop at target - motor_stop_target_weight, then apply bounded pulses based on 95th percentile flow rate.

### Why This Algorithm

- **Zero-shot learning algorithm**: An algorithm that needs no prior knowledge or manually tuned variables. Instantly adapts to changes in temperature, humidity, grinding coarseness, bean type, etc.
- **Two-tier approach**: Grinding is very noisy (mechanical, electrical) so we use a sophisticated approach:
  - First try to grind as fast as possible using a predictive algorithm where we try to just barely UNDERSHOOT the target weight (because overshoot is unrecoverable)
  - This learns us about the flow rate and grind latency (bean to cup time), which is used to predict when to stop the motor (coast time)
  - Then we use the worst (highest) 95th percentile flow rate to start pulsing until the cup is full. We're conservative because the real world is less predictable than we want. We err on undershooting to prevent overshoot. We repeat until the target ¬± tolerance is reached.

## üîå Installation

[<img src="images/wiring_diagram.png" alt="Wiring Diagram" width="50%">](images/wiring_diagram.png)

**Pin Configuration:**

**HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Connections:**
```
ESP32-S3 GPIO 2    ‚Üí    HX711 SCK
ESP32-S3 GPIO 3    ‚Üí    HX711 DOUT
ESP32-S3 3.3V      ‚Üí    HX711 VCC
ESP32-S3 GND       ‚Üí    HX711 GND
```

**Eureka Mignon Connections:**
```
ESP32-S3 GPIO 18   ‚Üí    WHITE wire (Motor control signal)
ESP32-S3 GND       ‚Üí    RED wire (‚ö†Ô∏è Ground - non-standard color!)
ESP32-S3 5V        ‚Üí    BLACK wire (‚ö†Ô∏è Power - non-standard color!)
                        GRAY wire (Button signal - not used)
```

**Eureka 4-Pin Connector Reference:**
- RED wire = GND (‚ö†Ô∏è non-standard!)
- WHITE wire = Motor control signal  
- GRAY wire = Button signal (unused in this project)
- BLACK wire = 5V power (‚ö†Ô∏è non-standard!)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Eureka uses reversed wire colors - RED is ground, BLACK is power!

**Installation Steps:**
1. Flash the firmware on the Waveshare board (see Build Instructions below)
2. Add the 1000ŒºF capacitor between 5V and ground (to protect against brownouts)
3. Create a plug connection for the HX711 to Waveshare board:
   - Add angled pin headers to the HX711 (VCC, GND, DOUT, SCK pins)
   - Connect dupont cables to the Waveshare board
   - Load cell can be directly soldered to the HX711
4. **For Eureka Mignon:**
   - Disassemble top plate and front plate. Remove the button and store it (we don't need this button anymore)
   - Use the JST-PH plug to connect to the waveshare board
   - **WARNING:** In some Eureka units, the wire colors to the screen are REVERSED! Test to be sure.
   - Mount the Waveshare screen using the 3D printed adapter plate where the original screen was
   - Fish the HX711 wire through the housing and have it exit via the hole where the button previously was
   - Mount the load cell and HX711 to the 3D printed back plate
   - Clip the 3D printed back plate onto the Eureka Mignon
   - Connect the plug to the HX711
   - Add the 3D printed cover plate and screw down
   - Add the 3D printed dosing cup holder on the load cell and screw down
   - Hide the screws with the 3D printed screw covers

## ‚öñÔ∏è Initial Calibration

After flashing the firmware to your device, you'll need to calibrate the load cell for accurate weight measurements:

1. **Access calibration**: Open Settings ‚Üí Swipe left to Tools tab ‚Üí Press "CALIBRATE"
2. **Empty calibration**: Remove all weight from the scale platform ‚Üí Press OK
3. **Weight calibration**: 
   - Place a known weight on the scale platform (e.g., coffee mug with water - weigh it first on a kitchen scale)
   - Use the +/- buttons to adjust the displayed weight value to match your known weight
   - Press OK to complete calibration

**Tip**: A coffee mug with some water makes an ideal calibration weight - just weigh it on a kitchen scale first to know the exact weight.

## üìù Personal Note

My goal with this project was to get real-life experience coding with AI agents. The code reflects that learning journey. I've learned a lot, but ultimately I'm in awe of how fast you can produce results with AI assistance. 

What I've learned so far is that "vibe coding" with AI is great for POCs and testing theories. But afterward you must pivot and reimplement features while keeping a close eye on the architecture the AI produces. Otherwise you'll get stuck at dead ends that require painful refactoring (been there, done that). 

In this project, that's most obvious when looking at the UI and state management - it's a bit cluttered in places. But I'm very happy with the end result and I'm releasing the project as is. It'll never be perfect, but it works great and transforms the coffee grinding experience.

**Project Status**: This project is shared 'as-is' and I have limited availability for support as I've already invested significant time in its development. While I'm happy to share what I've built, please understand that troubleshooting and feature requests may receive limited attention.
