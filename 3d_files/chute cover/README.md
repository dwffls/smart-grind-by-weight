# Chute Cover Design - Abandoned/Legacy Approach

⚠️ **This design is abandoned and incomplete** ⚠️

[<img src="chute cover.png" alt="Chute Cover 3D Design" width="50%">](chute cover.png)

## Overview

This folder contains an **abandoned 3D design** for a complete chute cover replacement that was originally intended to house the Waveshare ESP32-S3 AMOLED 1.64" display directly within the chute cover assembly.

## Why This Design Was Abandoned

The project has since **pivoted to a modular approach** using:
- Back plate (`Back plate.stl`)
- Waveshare adapter (`Waveshare AMOLED 1_64 adapter.stl`)
- Cover (`Cover.stl`)

This modular design is **easier to print**, **more reliable**, and **simpler to assemble**.

## Potential Use Cases

Despite being abandoned, this design can serve as an **excellent starting point** for adapting the Smart Grind-by-Weight modification to **other Eureka Mignon grinder models** that don't have an existing screen, such as:

- **Eureka Mignon Manuale**
- **Eureka Mignon Zero**
- **Eureka Mignon Silenzio**
- **Eureka Mignon Crono**

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

- **This design is NOT finished** and will require significant adjustments to work properly
- **No assembly instructions** are provided for this approach
- **Fit and finish issues** are likely and will need to be resolved
- **Use at your own risk** - this is experimental/prototype work
